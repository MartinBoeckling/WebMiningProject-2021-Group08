# Introduction to the repository
This Github repository is a collection of the documents (datasets and coding documents) for the Web Mining Project from the Summer Semester 2021 of Team 8 at the University of Mannheim. The python notebooks were all created by using Google Colab. If the user wants to run the notebooks f.e. in Jupyter Notebook, he needs to adapt mainly the data loading part to be able to run the models.
For rerunning the different models it is advisable to use a GPU to speed up the finetuning of the used models.
